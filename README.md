puppet-manifests
================

Repository housing puppet manifests developped by MBB at AAFC.

Note: Swift & docker manifests are stored in a module called dockerswift, contained in the modules/dockerswift. This allows them to be reused as part of other manifests.
To install puppet modules from source files, place the dockerswift directory into the /etc/puppet/modules/ directory on the master.
